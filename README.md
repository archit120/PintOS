PintOS Projects Repository
=======================

This repository contains code for the standard PintOS projects. To run simply type `make` and `make test` in the relevant directory.

The correctness of the code cannot be gauranteed. The standard test sets pass but the code has not validated by any course instructor. I have done this in my own free time outside of standard operating system courses.

The standard PintOS project 1-4 are implemented. This include 
 - User Programs
 - Threads
 - Virtual Memory
 - File System

For threads a simple strict priority based scheduler has been implemented. MLFQS has not been implemented.
